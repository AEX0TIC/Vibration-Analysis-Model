# Vibration-Analysis-Model
Vibration analysis with machine learning involves collecting data from sensors, preprocessing it by filtering noise and normalizing, and extracting features. Models like SVMs and neural networks are trained to detect anomalies and predict failures, enhancing predictive maintenance, reducing downtime, and improving efficiency.
